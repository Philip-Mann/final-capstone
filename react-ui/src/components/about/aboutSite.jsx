                    Nameless was built as a final project for DigitalCraft's Full Stack Development program in August 2021.
                    The purpose of this site is to respectfully raise awareness for deceased persons that are
                    still unidentified to this day. Although some doe cases involve live persons, a large portion unfortunatley
                    are victims of violent homicides. One of the first steps in a homicide investigation is to identify the victim
                    which allows investigators to bring closure to the victims family and administer justice to the perpatrators involved.
