            "description": "More than 40 years after his body was discovered in a septic tank in Tofield, the unknown murder victim, known as “Septic Tank Sam\", finally has a name. Gordon “Gordie” Edwin Sanderson, from Edmonton, was identified with the help of a Texas DNA lab that uses genetic genealogy, a novel forensic technique, Alberta RCMP told media Wednesday. He was about 25 when he was violently killed, and his body was found on an abandoned farm in 1977. Family made efforts to report him missing but police say there was never any evidence connecting him to this case. His killer has never been identified. Detectives are now seeking tips in the homicide investigation.",

            "description": "For more than four decades, cops believed the young couple shot to death and dumped off I-95 in South Carolina were Canadian. A slew of clues pointed them in that direction, including statements from the young man who claimed his father was a surgeon in Canada. Cops even called the male “Jock Doe” after a witness told detectives the man said his name was “Jacques” and he was from “French Canada.” One man told investigators he was told by the male victim that he and his girlfriend had bailed on his wealthy family in Canada and headed south. Jock Doe said his dad was a well-known doctor. Those riddles have now been put to rest. The Sumter County Sheriff’s Office says they have finally identified the remains of two homicide victims shot on Aug. 9, 1976. Their bodies were discovered by a passing trucker. Their names are Pamela Buckley, of Colorado Springs, Colo., and James Freund, of Lancaster, Pa.",
